Challenge 1 â€“ State Transition Testing

Project Title: Smart Gardening System (from Computer Architecture and Assembly Language Project)

Relation with State Transition: This system uses a Deterministic Finite Automata where the system will detect either the value of the subject used in the system is high or low. Then it will actuate the output to make sure the value of the subject in the garden become balance again.

Test Value:
Optimal value for moisture is 5 and above
// Optimal value for light intensity is 7 and above
// Optimal temperature is 305 and below
// Optimal PH is 5 and above
